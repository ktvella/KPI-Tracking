# KPI Tracking
A series of auto-updating Excel files to keep track of KPIs for the manufacuring floor at Hutchinson. Designed to identify problems and drive actions as required. Sheets were created to be easy to use and update by floor managers with no coding expertise. Note that the uploaded files are static with placeholder data, but actual sheets pull from Hutchinson databases to provide real-time updated info. 

## On-Time-Delivery (OTD)

The OTD file tracks customer orders that are behind schedule. Displays items by number of days late, as well as by dollars late. Helps us to identify large line items that are behind schedule, or items that are severly behind, in order to prioritize manufacturing schedule appropriately.
