# KPI Tracking

**KPI**: Key performance indicator to track progress and drive actions 

A series of auto-updating Excel files to keep track of KPIs for the manufacuring floor at Hutchinson. Designed to identify problems and drive actions as required. Sheets were created to be easy to use and update by floor managers with no coding expertise. Note that the uploaded files are static with placeholder data, but actual sheets pull from Hutchinson databases to provide real-time updated info. All a manager needs to do is click the Refresh Data button to access up-to-date information.

## On-Time-Delivery (OTD)

The OTD file tracks orders that are behind schedule. Displays items by number of days late, as well as by dollars late. Helps us to identify large line items that are behind schedule, or items that are severly behind, in order to prioritize manufacturing schedule appropriately. 

**Actions**: Scheduling to prioritize behind schedule orders when components become available, floor managers to prioritize/streamline behind-schedule orders


## Scrap

The Scrap file tracks items or components that had to be scrapped from the system. This can help us to identify manufacturing processes with low yield that need to be improved, items that are coming from suppliers that are not to spec, or surplus ordering of components that have expired. 

**Actions**: Manufacturing Engineers to evaluate process, Tool Shop to evaluate manufacuting tools

## Quality Nonconformance Reports (NCRs)

Whenever a part or component is caught that is not up to quality standards, a Nonconformance Report is generated. The NCR file tracks the top items that generate NCRs, as well as the total count of NCRs by month. Similar to the scrap sheet, this metric helps us identify processes that need improvement. Additionally, it helps us track our overall quality trends and improvements over time. 

**Actions**: Quality Engineers to evaluate supplier quality, Design Engineers to evaluate any excessivly tight requirements, Manufacturing Engineers to evaluate processes. 

## Variances

The Variance sheet tracks the top 5 items with positive or negative variance. Variance is the deviation from the expected cost to produce a part. It includes the cost of components, labor, and overhead. A positive variance means that a product cost more than expected to produce, and a negative variance means it cost less than expected to produce. Either way, a variance indicates that the process is producing unexpected waste or taking more or less time than predicted. This metric helps us to identify processes that need evaluation or parts that need the times on the instructions need to be updated. 

**Actions**: Manufacturing Engineering to evlauate process efficiency, update instruction times if required. Design Engineer to evaluate BOM over/under usage.
