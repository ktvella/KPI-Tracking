# KPI Tracking
A series of auto-updating Excel files to keep track of KPIs for the manufacuring floor at Hutchinson. Designed to identify problems and drive actions as required. Sheets were created to be easy to use and update by floor managers with no coding expertise. Note that the uploaded files are static with placeholder data, but actual sheets pull from Hutchinson databases to provide real-time updated info. All a manager needs to do is click the Refresh Data button to access up-to-date information.

## On-Time-Delivery (OTD)

The OTD file tracks customer orders that are behind schedule. Displays items by number of days late, as well as by dollars late. Helps us to identify large line items that are behind schedule, or items that are severly behind, in order to prioritize manufacturing schedule appropriately. 

## Scrap

The Scrap file tracks items or components that had to be scrapped from the system. This can help us to identify manufacturing processes with low yield that need to be improved, items that are coming from suppliers that are not to spec, or surplus ordering of components that have expired.
